About IBM Decision Optimization on Cloud
-------------

<a href="www.ibm.com/software/analytics/docloud">IBM Decision Optimization on Cloud</a> or DOcloud for short is a service 
that lets you solve CPLEX and OPL problems on the Cloud. You can access the interactive service called DropSolve or you can 
use the API to integrate the service into your application. Here is a quick introduction with useful links. This module

showing how to use this API.
